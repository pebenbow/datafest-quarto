## What is Quarto?

Quarto is a **publishing framework**, not all that different from R Markdown and Python notebooks, that allows you to blend text content with code cells, data visualizations, and other content, and produce a full-fledged, interactive product.

It supports coding in R, Python, SQL, Julia, ObservableJS, and more!

## Why use Quarto?

- Can be used to write books, blogs, reports, etc.
- **Can be used to present your DataFest project!**
- **Can be used to build websites that showcase your data science projects to employers!**
- Can be used to produce academic papers via LaTeX (including templates for specific journals like JASA!)

## Goals of this workshop

- Learn how to use Quarto with Python and R to create websites
- Learn how to deploy a Quarto website using GitHub Pages
